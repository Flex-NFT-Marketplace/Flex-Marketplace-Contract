**CurrencyManager**

The CurrencyManager contract allows the owner to manage a whitelist of currencies, storing them and their indices using LegacyMap.

***Key Features***
 - **Ownership Control**: Only the owner can modify the whitelist using OpenZeppelin's `OwnableComponent`.  
 - **Whitelisting Currencies**: The owner can add or remove currencies from the whitelist.  
 - **Event-Driven**: Events notify changes to the whitelist for transparency and communication. 


***Contract Functions***

1. `initializer(ref self: ContractState, owner: ContractAddress, proxy_admin: ContractAddress)` :
   
   Sets up the initial state of the contract. assigns the owner and ensures that the contract can only be initialized once. If the contract has already been initialized, it will throw an error. It also calls the initializer function of the OwnableComponent to manage ownership logic.

2. `add_currency(ref self: ContractState, currency: ContractAddress)` :

    Allows the contract owner to add a new currency to the whitelist. It first checks if the currency is already whitelisted by looking up its index. If not, it increments the count of whitelisted currencies, adds the new currency to the list, and updates the mapping of currency indices. Then emits a `CurrencyWhitelisted` event with the current timestamp.

3. `remove_currency(ref self: ContractState, currency: ContractAddress)` :

   Allows the owner to remove a currency from the whitelist. verifies whether the currency is currently whitelisted by checking its index. If whitelisted, it replaces the currency with the last one in the list, updates the indices, and reduces the count of whitelisted currencies also emits a `CurrencyRemoved` event with the current timestamp.

4. `is_currency_whitelisted(self: @ContractState, currency: ContractAddress) -> bool` :

    This function checks if a given currency is on the whitelist by looking up its index. If the index is non-zero, the currency is considered whitelisted, and the function returns true; otherwise, it returns `false`.

5. `whitelisted_currency_count(self: @ContractState) -> usize` :

    Returns the total number of currencies currently on the whitelist. It simply reads the `whitelisted_currency_count` from storage, which tracks how many currencies have been added to the whitelist.

6.  `whitelisted_currency(self: @ContractState, index: usize) -> ContractAddress` :

    Retrieves the currency at a specific position in the whitelist based on the provided index. It looks up the currencyâ€™s address in the list and returns it. useful for iterating through or displaying the list of whitelisted currencies.

**ExecutionManager**
The ExecutionManager contract manages a whitelist of authorized strategies, with ownership control via OwnableComponent.

***Key Features***
 - **Ownership and Access Control**: The contract uses `OwnableComponent` to restrict critical functions to the owner.  
 - **Strategy Whitelisting**: The contract manages a whitelist of execution strategies by their `ContractAddress`.  
 - **Event Emission**: Events are emitted when strategies are added or removed, ensuring transparency.

***Contract Functions***
1. `initializer(ref self: ContractState, owner: ContractAddress)` :
   
    Initializes the contract, setting up the initial state and assigning the owner. ensures the contract is only initialized once by checking if it has already been initialized `(assert!(!self.initialized.read(), "ExecutionManager: already initialized");)`. Once initialized, the `OwnableComponent` is set up with the provided owner address.

2. `add_strategy(ref self: ContractState, strategy: ContractAddress)` :

    Allows the owner to add a new strategy to the whitelist. checks if the strategy is already whitelisted using the `whitelisted_strategies_index` map. If not, the strategy is added, the strategy count is incremented, and a `StrategyWhitelisted` event is emitted.

3. `remove_strategy(ref self: ContractState, strategy: ContractAddress)` :

    Allows the owner to remove a strategy from the whitelist. It verifies that the strategy is currently whitelisted, then removes it and adjusts the indices in the list. A `StrategyRemoved` event is emitted to inform external observers of the change.

4. `is_strategy_whitelisted(self: @ContractState, strategy: ContractAddress) -> bool` :

    Checks if a specific strategy is whitelisted. returns `true` if the strategy is on the whitelist and `false` if it is not. This is crucial for determining the validity of a strategy before execution.

5. `get_whitelisted_strategies_count(self: @ContractState) -> usize` :

    Returns the total number of whitelisted strategies. It provides a simple way to retrieve the size of the whitelist, which can be useful for iterating over all strategies or for display purposes.

6. `get_whitelisted_strategy(self: @ContractState, index: usize) -> ContractAddress` :

    Retrieves a strategy from the whitelist based on its index. It allows external contracts or users to access specific strategies by their position in the list, enabling iteration or specific strategy retrieval for execution or analysis.

* `can_execute_taker_ask` : Validates whether a takerâ€™s ask (selling request) can be matched with a makerâ€™s bid (buying offer). It checks that the price and token ID match, and that the maker's bid is within a valid time range.

* `can_execute_taker_bid` : Similar to `can_execute_taker_ask` , but for matching a takerâ€™s bid (buying request) with a makerâ€™s ask (selling offer).

4. **Security and Validation** :
  Performs several checks to ensure the validity of orders. For example, it verifies that the orderâ€™s timing is correct (e.g., the current block timestamp is within the start and end time specified in the makerâ€™s order) and that the price and token ID match between the buyer and seller. These checks ensure that transactions are fair and adhere to the agreed-upon terms, preventing issues like undercutting or executing orders that are no longer valid.

5. **Upgrade Mechanism** :
  The `upgrade` function allows the contract owner to upgrade the contract's implementation by providing a new class hash `impl_hash`. It is crucial for maintaining the contract's relevance and security over time as it allows for bug fixes, optimizations, and new features to be added without deploying a new contract.

It ensures that only the authorized marketplace contract can initiate these transfers, adding a layer of security. The function utilizes the `IERC721CamelOnlyDispatcher` to perform the token transfer, enforcing that the caller is the marketplace.

* **Secure Transfer Verification** : Before executing a transfer, the contract verifies that the caller is indeed the marketplace contract. This prevents unauthorized transfers and ensures that the transfer logic aligns with marketplace transactions.

  **Marketplace Address Management** :
 - **update_marketplace** : This function allows the contract owner to update the address of the marketplace contract. This is useful if the marketplace contract needs to be replaced or upgraded, ensuring the `TransferManagerNFT` contract remains compatible with the correct marketplace.
