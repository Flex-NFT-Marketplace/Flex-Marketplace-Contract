## Experimental ERC-7765 (RWA) Integration

A test implementation of the (ERC-7765)[https://github.com/Mint-Blockchain/ERCs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-7765.md] for RWA integration into NFTs. Essentially, this extends ERC721 meaning the token should be compatible with ERC-721, as well as extending the functionality for the specific RWA use case.

The additional functionality consists of a set of preset privileges that can be exercised by the token holder.
