## Objective:

Explore and implement an experimental feature that enables NFT fractionalization, allowing multiple users to own fractions of a single NFT.

## Implementation Details:

- The design and implementation approach are at the discretion of the assignee.
- Consider various methods for fractionalization (e.g., ERC-20 token wrappers, smart contract adjustments, etc.).
- Ensure compatibility with existing NFT standards and platforms.

### What you need to know about Fractional NFTs:
- A fractionalized NFT is an NFT divided into multiple pieces. 
- It lowers the barrier of entry, as the NFT fractions cost less than the full token.
- An NFT owner can fractionalize a token even if they aren't the token's creator.
- The original NFT gets locked in aÂ smart contract, which creates a predetermined number of fungible tokens, each representing a piece of the NFT.
- In some ways, fractionalized NFTs more closely resemble a cryptocurrency than an NFT.
